Introduction
============

The **JRoyale** android library (.aar) wraps the light-weight camera framework for time-of-flight
(ToF) cameras (**Royale SDK**).
JRoyale contains all the logic which is required to talk the Royale SDK and within this to operate
a ToF based camera. The user need not care about writing native java code (JNI), but can
conveniently communicate to Royale inside the Java Environment.

JRoyale officially supports the **CamBoard pico flexx**, **CamBoard pico maxx** and
**CamBoard pico monstar** cameras.
