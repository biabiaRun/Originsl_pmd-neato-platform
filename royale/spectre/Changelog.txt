Change Log {#change_log}
========

Spectre 4.1.0
--------------

Spectre 4.1 is the first release to support checker-board imagers. The
implementation is optimized for readability. It starts with a limited set of
algorithms:

- smoothingFilter
- filterAdaptiveNoise
- filterNFreq
- filterFlyingPixel

Further algorithms, and a backend optimized for computational speed will be
added in later versions.

#### Misc. ####

- Extended spectreRrfParameterSetter to remove parameters from an input file
- Added a tool to exchange the calibration data in an RRF
- Added support for XYZ reference data in system tests
- Removed remaining references to spectre3
- Moved VariantTest to common to match the new location of Variant in Spectre
  4.0
- Adapted AstonInitTest to run for all backends compiled into
  libSpectre/libProcessing
- libCalibration will now skip unknown fields in JGF files instead of
  returning an error
- Fixed a bug to remove a possible "fixed grid" which does not depend on the
  actual image contents in the MPI algorithm.


Spectre 4.0.0
--------------

New major release of Spectre with numerous changes to the internals as well
the API layer.

#### Important Changes ####

- Reconfiguration of Spectre now is based on a two step approach: Users first
  select a basic configuration (e.g., modulation frequencies), and can select
  in the next step the available extended options.
- API and depth-compuation backend has been decoupled.
- Multi-threading has been moved from the API layer to the libProcessing layer.
- Multiple depth-computation backends are now available in libSpectre. The API
  automatically selects one based on the requested configuration. More
  optimized backends might be added in the future.

#### Known Issues ####

- The documentation for libProcessing, and the multi-threading architecture is
  no longer up to date. It will be improved in the following releases of Spectre
  4.
- The IProcessingBackend interface is not fully stable, and might be altered
  later on. This should not result in any changes for API users.
- The ProcessingDispatcher, and the CMake configuration is still available in
  the 4.0.0 release for legacy reasons. But the API will ignore it, and use
  the new dynamic backend selection. It will be removed completely in later
  iterations of Spectre 4.
  

Spectre 3.13.3
--------------

#### Calibration ####

Added a new field SPECTRE\_BENTLEY\_IMAGER\_TYPE to indicate if a
calibration is for checker board imagers (type = 1) or for dense imagers (type
= 0). If the field is not present in a calibration file, a dense imager is
assumed.

Spectre 3.13.2
--------------

#### Bugfixes ####

Fixed a possible race condition in the hole filling algorithm

  inclusion with the pmd ToF calibration software

### Bugfixes  ###

- Fixed a critical bug which lead to wrong computation results if the
  straylight approximation option was used in combination with
  multi-threading, and specific camera resolustions.
- Prevent usage of ARM NEON version with resolutions not divisible by 4,
  because this is not supported.
- Straylight removal once again works if used together with global binning


#### Misc. ####

  not supported by Royale, but only by Spectre 

### Spectre 4 Preparations ###

- Refactored libProcessing to support multiple depth-processing
  implementations.

  reconfiguration, instead libProcessing will use a shadow (intermediate)
  calibration for changes if they are necessary



Spectre 3.11.0
--------------

### General ###

- Added a new calcAutoExposure algorithm. The new exposure times are now calculated
  based on raw data and fpn. If no calibration is present a fixed value for fpn will be 
  used instead.

### Misc.  ###

- Added support for changing parameters in system test RRFs.
- Added an IExtendedSpectre interface, so that new features for Spectre 4.0 can be 
  added internally without exposing them to the public interface.

Spectre 3.10.0
--------------

### General ###

- Added support to control the accuracy of the stray light model. Spectre
  defaults now to an approximation level of 4 which will lower the
  computational load of the stray light removal algorithm significantly. The
  old behavior can be restored by setting the approximation level to 1.
- Optimized the filter2Freq implementation on the ARM platform
- Changed the behavior of the getSpectre function
  - getSpectre without any hint defaults to multi threaded processing
    if neither the reference platform is active, nor an auto exposure only

    default is single threaded processing
  - Multi threaded processing defaults now to two threads

#### Bugfixes ####

- Fixed documentation generation for libProcessing
- Fixed a bug which could lead to stripes of flagged pixels in the depth image
  if global binning was activated
- InspectorSpectre now works again together with gdbserver, and remote debugging

  single-threading (this is transparent for the user)
- Adapted noiseThreshold parameter so that lower inputs are allowed
- Added query function for unambiguous range
- Updated Spectre libs to gcc5, Ubuntu 14.04 is now no longer supported instead

experimental feature SpectreFactoryHint::MULTI_THREADED can be passed
to the factory function spectre::getSpectre. In this case Spectre will
offer a new ParameterKey::NUMBER_THREADS which can be used to change
the number of threads on-the-fly.
*Note:* Using more than one thread is not supported if the sparse-point
cloud or straylight correction is activated.
