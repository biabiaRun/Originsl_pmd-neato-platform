<div class="textblock"><h2>Spectre 4.1.0</h2>
<p>Spectre 4.1 is the first release to support checker-board imagers. The implementation is optimized for readability. It starts with a limited set of algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>smoothingFilter</li>
<li>filterAdaptiveNoise</li>
<li>filterNFreq</li>
<li>filterFlyingPixel</li>
</ul>
<p>Further algorithms, and a backend optimized for computational speed will be added in later versions.</p>
<h4>Misc.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extended spectreRrfParameterSetter to remove parameters from an input file</li>
<li>Added a tool to exchange the calibration data in an RRF</li>
<li>Added support for XYZ reference data in system tests</li>
<li>Removed remaining references to spectre3</li>
<li>Moved VariantTest to common to match the new location of Variant in Spectre 4.0</li>
<li>Adapted AstonInitTest to run for all backends compiled into libSpectre/libProcessing</li>
<li>libCalibration will now skip unknown fields in JGF files instead of returning an error</li>
<li>Fixed a bug to remove a possible "fixed grid" which does not depend on the actual image contents in the MPI algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spectre 4.0.0</h2>
<p>New major release of Spectre with numerous changes to the internals as well the API layer.</p>
<h4>Important Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reconfiguration of Spectre now is based on a two step approach: Users first select a basic configuration (e.g., modulation frequencies), and can select in the next step the available extended options.</li>
<li>API and depth-compuation backend has been decoupled.</li>
<li>Multi-threading has been moved from the API layer to the libProcessing layer.</li>
<li>Multiple depth-computation backends are now available in libSpectre. The API automatically selects one based on the requested configuration. More optimized backends might be added in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>The documentation for libProcessing, and the multi-threading architecture is no longer up to date. It will be improved in the following releases of Spectre 4.</li>
<li>The IProcessingBackend interface is not fully stable, and might be altered later on. This should not result in any changes for API users.</li>
<li>The ProcessingDispatcher, and the CMake configuration is still available in the 4.0.0 release for legacy reasons. But the API will ignore it, and use the new dynamic backend selection. It will be removed completely in later iterations of Spectre 4.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spectre 3.13.3</h2>
<h4>Calibration</h4>
<p>Added a new field SPECTRE_BENTLEY_IMAGER_TYPE to indicate if a calibration is for checker board imagers (type = 1) or for dense imagers (type = 0). If the field is not present in a calibration file, a dense imager is assumed.</p>
<h2>Spectre 3.13.2</h2>
<h4>Bugfixes</h4>
<p>Fixed a possible race condition in the hole filling algorithm</p>
<h2>Spectre 3.13.1</h2>

</ul>
<h3>Spectre 4 Preparations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactored libProcessing to support multiple depth-processing implementations.</li>
<li>The internal calibration structure is no longer changed during reconfiguration, instead libProcessing will use a shadow (intermediate) calibration for changes if they are necessary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spectre 3.11.0</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Spectre 3.10.0</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support to control the accuracy of the stray light model. Spectre defaults now to an approximation level of 4 which will lower the computational load of the stray light removal algorithm significantly. The old behavior can be restored by setting the approximation level to 1.</li>
<li>Optimized the filter2Freq implementation on the ARM platform</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of the getSpectre function<ul>

</ul>
